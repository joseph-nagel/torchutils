# PyTorch utilities
This repository contains utilites realizing Keras-like convenience for PyTorch.
More particularly, a high-level training routine for classifiers is implemented.
It can be used in conjunction with all appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Common tasks related to data preprocessing and pretrained models are also facilitated.
Simple examples demonstrate the training of neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR10.
